# Serialize Action Example

This example shows how to serialize and deserialize typed Action.

#### Install
```
npm install
```

> Note: You'll see the warning `Unmet peer dependency "redux@^2.0.0 || ^3.0.0"`. That is because react-redux uses Redux's `bindActionCreators` function, a workaround is to use Webpack's module resolve config to resolve redux to typed-redux.

#### Run
```
npm start
open http://localhost:8080/
```
